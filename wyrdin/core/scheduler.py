This module implements the Scheduler class.

class Scheduler():
    """
    Scheduler is the active role in the Wyrd In system. It tries to order known
    tasks towards some criterion, be it the throughput, latency, fairness (cf.
    process scheduling in computers), best fit for available amount time,
    meeting deadlines, exploiting the opportunity, user's mood (perhaps
    specified by the user, or maybe guessed), the horoscope, or something else.
    These different kinds of scheduling should be implemented in subclasses of
    Scheduler, while the user has to retain the ability to switch the
    scheduling algorithm at any time for minimal cost. For that, task schedules
    devised by any scheduler shall be cached. Whenever they need to be
    recomputed, this should be done effectively. Ideally, each change in the
    set of tasks should cause only a local change in the schedule. Moreover,
    many transitions (such as completing the current task) can be guessed, and
    their effect on the schedule can (and should) be precomputed.

class ScheduleRestrictions()
    """
    Objects of this class represent restrictions on a schedule. This object
    will be used in the notorious scenario of scheduling for the current day,
    when the user specifies what tasks he wants to work on, and this selection
    of tasks will be scheduled somehow by the scheduler (perhaps using
    RandomScheduler, or NoneScheduler to produce just the set of tasks). The
    selection of tasks is what is represented by this class.
